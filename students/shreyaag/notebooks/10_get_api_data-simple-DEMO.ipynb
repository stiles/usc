    "This notebook has two simple excerises demonstrating how to extract data from an [Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). An API is a tool for computers or applications to interact with one another. In our case, we'll be asking for data, and the API will return it. These systems can be complicated, but most of those we might use in data journalism are relatively simple."

In fact, the “let me in, let me out, let me in” phenomenon is a good example. The bigger cat ostensibly rules the territory and therefore should be the one patrolling and marking it with pee so other cats stay away.

       "      <td>An estimated 50% of today's cat owners never take their cats to a veterinarian for health care. Too, because cats tend to keep their problems to themselves, many owners think their cat is perfectly healthy when actually they may be suffering from a life-threatening disease. Therefore, cats, on an average, are much sicker than dogs by the time they are brought to your veterinarian for treatment.</td>\n",

       "408  Since cats treat us like cats and depend on us for things like food, water, and opening the door to let them out, they do recognize, that we are in some way in charge — the “big cat” in the shared territory. As territorial animals, our cats are constantly wondering why we’re not doing other cat things that the big cat would normally do in their territory. In fact, the “let me in, let me out, let me in” phenomenon is a good example. The bigger cat ostensibly rules the territory and therefore should be the one patrolling and marking it with pee so other cats stay away. But since humans don’t do this, indoor-outdoor cats reluctantly take on the role themselves. The apparent neuroticism of cats wanting to go outside every five minutes only to be let right back in is funny to us because it seems so silly and unnecessary. But to the cats, it’s very necessary (and frustrating) to cover for their dumb pals.   \n",

Too, because cats tend to keep their problems to themselves, many owners think their cat is perfectly healthy when actually they may be suffering from a life-threatening disease. Therefore, cats, on an average, are much sicker than dogs by the time they are brought to your veterinarian for treatment.   \n",
