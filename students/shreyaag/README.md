# USC - JOUR 561 - Rhysea

This is Rhysea's repository.
This folder contains my data, demos, sample code and assignments for spring 2022!

Those with evil intentions, you'll be banished (if I find out, that is).







Notes you probably don't want to read:

Please **pull** the latest notebooks and data from here each week when you get into class.

**Commit** your work to personal repos. 

*Files from JOUR 554 in fall 2021 can be found [in the archive](https://github.com/stiles/usc/tree/main/archive).*
