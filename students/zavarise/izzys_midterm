Pitch: This dataset shows that more arrests are occurring in South Los Angeles compared to areas like West L.A. Based on what I've learned, I'd like to do a piece on arrests broken down by area and look into why some areas have a higher arrest rate.
​
In this dataset, I also learned that the average age of arrest is 35. I'd like to do a story that looks at the relationship between age and crime. How does getting arrested at 35 impact your life versus getting arrested in your 20s? What kinds of crimes are more common among people in their 30s?
​
I'm also interested in doing a story on 90-year-olds who have been arrested.
