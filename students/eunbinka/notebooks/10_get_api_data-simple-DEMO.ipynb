    "This notebook has two simple excerises demonstrating how to extract data from an [Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). An API is a tool for computers or applications to interact with one another. In our case, we'll be asking for data, and the API will return it. These systems can be complicated, but most of those we might use in data journalism are relatively simple."

This disease can cause illness in the human, but more seriously, can cause birth defects in the unborn. Toxoplasmosis is a common disease, sometimes spread through the feces of cats. It is caused most often from eating raw or rare beef. Pregnant women and people with a depressed immune system should not touch the cat litter box. Other than that, there is no reason that these people have to avoid cats.   \n",
