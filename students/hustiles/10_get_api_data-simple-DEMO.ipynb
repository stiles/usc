    "This notebook has two simple excerises demonstrating how to extract data from an [Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). An API is a tool for computers or applications to interact with one another. In our case, we'll be asking for data, and the API will return it. These systems can be complicated, but most of those we might use in data journalism are relatively simple."
